# Community Module - Mobile App Sandbox

This module is a component of our mobile app sandbox, specifically designed to prototype and test the community feed section of our application. It serves as a dedicated space for experimenting with different ways to display and interact with community content.

## Purpose

* **Community Feed Prototyping:** To visualize and test various layouts and interaction patterns for the community feed on mobile devices.
* **Content Display Exploration:** To experiment with different ways of presenting posts, user information, and media.
* **Interaction Testing:** To prototype basic interactions like scrolling, liking, commenting (simulated in the sandbox).
* **Sandbox Environment:** To develop and test community feed features without affecting the main application.

## Features (in this Sandbox)

* **Basic Feed Structure:** Provides a foundational HTML structure to represent a list of community posts.
* **Simple Post Representation:** Basic HTML elements to display individual posts (text, user, etc.).
* **Placeholder Content:** Includes placeholder content to visualize how posts might look.
* **Loading Simulation:** Basic JavaScript to simulate the loading of community content.
* **Adaptable Structure:** HTML designed to be easily modified to represent different post layouts and content types.
* **Basic Styling:** Minimal CSS for a clear visual representation of the feed.


## Usage (within the Sandbox)

1.  **Import the Module:**

    ```javascript
    import { initializeCommunity } from '../modules/community/src/community.js';
    ```

2.  **HTML Placeholder:**

    ```html
    <div id="community-container"></div>
    ```

3.  **Initialize the Module:**

    ```javascript
    initializeCommunity('community-container');
    ```

## Sandbox Customization

* **HTML Structure:** Modify `src/community/src/community.html` to experiment with different post layouts and content elements.
* **CSS Styling:** Adjust `src/community/src/community.css` to prototype various visual styles for the feed and individual posts.
* **JavaScript Logic:** Add temporary JavaScript in `src/community/src/community.js` to simulate loading more content, basic interactions (like/comment), or different data fetching scenarios.
* **Placeholder Data:** Modify the placeholder content in the HTML to represent different types of community posts.

## Example (Sandbox Code)

```javascript
// In your sandbox's index.js
import { initializeCommunity } from '../modules/community/src/community.js';

initializeCommunity('community-container');
